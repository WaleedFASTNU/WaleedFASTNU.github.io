            In today’s architecture of sharing credentials and information with
            another party, everything is centralized which makes it prone to
            forgery, impersonation, damage, theft along with many other things
            [1]. In traditional online banking systems, the sender and receiver
            of a transaction achieve their goals due to the presence of a middle
            party in between which is the bank itself. This communication occurs
            on the basis of trust as both the sender and the receiver trust the
            bank to process the transaction properly. What if the sender and
            receiver were to achieve their respective goals without any
            intermediate roleplayer so that their communication stays solely
            between them? This is what a blockchain offers. The decentralized
            nature of blockchain provides users a unified, interoperable and
            tamper-proof infrastructure enabling secure management and storage
            of information without the need for a middle entity. The information
            regarding an individual’s identification stored on the internet is
            known as digital identity. Using the blockchain technology, this
            digital identity can be secured in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens
            in the name of the rightful owners who can choose where their data
            goes, who they want to share it with. The primary motive of this
            project is to provide a self-sovereign identity [2] management
            system for securing the authenticity of an individual’s
            identification and make its attestation process easier by the use of
            a blockchain. The verifier of any digital identity can verify its
            validity by looking at the issuer's (government, university etc)
            signature on the blockchain after they request access from the
            holder (owner of the digital identity). In traditional systems, the
            centralized authority holds the user's account and hence their
            digital identity. As a result, this third party can control the
            account, disable it or revoke the user's access at any time.
            However, through the use of Blockchain infrastructure and
            Decentralized Identifiers [3], we aim to put the control of their
            digital identities back into the hands of the users.
